# Project_1-Store_Item_Demand_Forecasting

This project is part of the kaggle competition “Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge” . 
We are given 5 years of store-item sales data, and asked to predict 3 months of sales for 50 different items at 10 different stores .
This is a time series problem where we have to try different time series techniques to arrive at the best score.
Submissions are evaluated on SMAPE between forecasts and actual values.Here SMAPE=0 when the actual and predicted values are both 0.



**Data fields:**

date - Date of the sale data. There are no holiday effects or store closures.

store - Store ID

item - Item ID

sales - Number of items sold at a particular store on a particular date.
